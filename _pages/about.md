<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) supervised by <a href='https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~xyliu/'>Prof. LIU, Xunying</a> & <a href='https://chenxie95.github.io/'>Prof. CHEN, Xie</a>. 

My research interests focus on long-context speech processing and recognition.
