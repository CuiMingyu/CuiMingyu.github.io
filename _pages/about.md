# About Me
I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) supervised by <a href='https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~xyliu/'>Prof. LIU Xunying</a> and co-supervised by <a href='https://chenxie95.github.io/'>Prof. CHEN Xie</a>. Before that, I finished my Master and Bachelor degrees in CUHK and SouthEast University (SEU) respectively.

My research interests focus on long-context speech processing and recognition based on Fairseq and ESPnet.
